# **🖥 https://fancybaguette.github.io/**
- My github.io page repository
- I mainly use this site for hosting my Frontend Mentor challange solutions
- I often redo the site as i learn more

## **📚 Used libraries**
- ![Animate.css](https://www.animate.style)

## **📁 Projects folder**

Folder containing all the other stuff that isn't frontendmentor challanges. Right now it's the place for small projects that came up in my mind and also some solo projects from Scrimba web dev courses.

**Current projects:** 
- VW to PX Converter
- Password generator
- Invoice creator

## **📁 Legacy folder**

Folder containing the old website / previous iterations of it.

**Front end mentor challanges are located in a separate repository**
